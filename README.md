👋 Hi, I’m Siddart, a back-end developer based in Texas.

🧠 I specialize in Java with Spring Boot, building robust APIs and microservices.

🛠️ I’ve worked with C# and have some experience with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for front-end work.

☁️ I'm passionate about cloud technologies—especially AWS—and hold multiple AWS certifications.

🌱 Currently exploring Golang to evaluate its performance and developer experience compared to Java.

💡 Always curious, always learning—whether it’s sharpening my architecture skills or diving into new frameworks.
